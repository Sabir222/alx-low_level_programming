# C Programming Language

## Introduction

C is a general-purpose programming language initially developed by Dennis Ritchie at Bell Labs in the early 1970s. It is widely used for system-level programming and is considered one of the most influential programming languages in the history of computing. C is known for its efficiency, portability, and close relationship with the hardware, making it a popular choice for operating systems, embedded systems, and low-level programming tasks.

## Key Features 

Mid-level language: C combines features of high-level languages, like structured programming, with low-level capabilities for memory manipulation and direct hardware access.
Procedural programming: C follows the procedural programming paradigm, where programs are composed of functions and procedures.
Static typing: C is statically typed, meaning variable types are determined at compile-time rather than runtime.
Rich library support: C comes with a standard library that provides many built-in functions and data types to facilitate common programming tasks.
Pointer manipulation: C allows direct memory manipulation through pointers, which is essential for tasks like dynamic memory allocation and working with hardware.
